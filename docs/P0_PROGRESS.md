# P0 progress snapshot — 12 October 2026

**Feature implementation is largely complete. Release acceptance is incomplete.**
This short view summarizes `P0_RELEASE_STATUS.md`; its dated entries and JSON evidence remain authoritative for exact scope. A passing build is not native workflow acceptance. No percentage is assigned because remaining gates have very different risk and effort.

| Area | Proven progress | Remaining gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Productive widgets | Twelve kinds implemented; many installed iPhone/iPad configurations, cold/warm routes, completion, account switches and app privacy controls verified | Installed Mac hosts; remaining supported sizes/conditions; system privacy redaction |
| Todoist import | Real read-only multi-page import and replay; native imported-workspace handoff; iPhone lost first-import and replay-response recovery; Mac lost replay-response Retry and relaunch | Named native import/retry gate closed; evidence retains exact scope |
| Recovery | Native portable export/restore, encrypted Mac safety copy, cloud and cross-account restore/replay/relaunch; native Mac shared-access loss, encrypted recovery/apply and durable notice | External provider-backed file transfer and remaining failure boundaries |
| Device continuity | Native Mac ↔ phone tasks/notes/planning/organization round trips, offline edits and relaunches; paired name/photo and native Mac attachment handoffs | Remaining concurrency/legacy-client variants |
| Core usability | Capture/editor/subtasks/completion/Undo fixes; Mac calendar keyboard navigation; scoped phone/tablet normal and largest-text calendar routes | Spoken VoiceOver; four retained clipping reports (photo/note/chip, not four confirmed visible defects); remaining critical landscape/sidebar flows |
| Notifications | Mac Focus authorization, scheduling, pause/resume, background banner and terminated-app Notification Center delivery evidence | Actual notification Open/action/terminated/account-change journeys; real APNs delivery and rollout proof |
| Distribution | Independent repositories and development builds | Mac app provisioning blocked by current Personal Team’s Push Notifications limit; enrolled team, Developer ID/notarization and distribution signing |

## How to interpret recent activity

Recent work includes actual user-visible calendar/accessibility fixes, native workflow verification, test-driver corrections, signing/Simulator problems and evidence maintenance. These are different kinds of progress and should not be combined into a claim that all P0 is done. Calendar coverage is bounded; additional combinations are not automatically new release requirements.

## Next execution order

1. Scoped landscape Today task/Search/rotation and capture checks now pass normal/largest native cases (`landscape-today-evidence.json`). The strengthened named saved-capture row checks also pass functional assertions, and the retained publishing warning is now attributed to background midnight delivery and fixed in both apps with a deterministic before/after regression (`background-calendar-evidence.json`). General long-row visibility remains open. Compact landscape keyboard-visible Save/More and editing-line access now pass after the bounded iPhone fix (`keyboard-capture-evidence.json`); other keyboard flows retain their existing scope. Presented Search now also passes unfiltered normal/largest placeholder/query audits after shortening its visible prompt (`presented-search-audit-evidence.json`). The refreshed four other reports remain retained. Move next to the import/notification gates rather than additional calendar combinations.
2. Native Mac replay response-loss/Retry now passes in the fresh signed current-source app (`mac-import-retry-native-evidence.json`); its obsolete waiting launch is retired and needs no further approval. Move to real Mac notification actions. iPhone first-import response-loss recovery retains its accepted scope (`first-import-recovery-evidence.json`).
3. Complete critical accessibility/attachment journeys, then the outstanding installed widget hosts.
4. Close APNs and distribution gates with actual credentials/signing/delivery evidence. Revalidate current availability before describing any external prerequisite as blocked.

Ordinary iPhone/iPad acceptance uses Xcode Simulators as requested. Actual remote delivery and distribution remain separate gates. Todoist source data must remain unchanged. Each repo owns its code and release inputs; completed work is committed and pushed separately.

## Latest closed gate

12 October: native Mac → iPhone → Mac profile name/photo handoff now passes, including both normal process relaunches. Exact server baseline and original profile are restored; primary phone/iPad data are unchanged. See `profile-pair-evidence.json`. No new production fix was needed.

12 October: named native Mac replay response-loss/Retry now also passes, including actual quit/relaunch and exact preservation. Fresh stable development signing removes the preceding import-launch approval friction. The initial NSTableView warning remains open.

12 October: authenticated native Mac attachment handoff now passes through iPhone preview/relaunch, a phone notes edit and Mac foreground sync/relaunch/preview. The small PNG remains byte-for-byte and metadata-identical. Native cleanup restores all 14 non-activity server tables; two synthetic creation/deletion ledger entries remain. See `attachment-handoff-evidence.json`. External file-provider transfer remains open.

12 October: fixed the visibly clipped largest-text landscape capture draft. Compact focused capture now keeps one complete editing line with its end caret visible. Two native normal/largest Save/More/relaunch cases pass without runtime warnings. Exact title/estimate persist; authenticated cache, all 15 server tables and protected devices are unchanged. See `keyboard-capture-evidence.json`.

## Current external prerequisite

12 October: automatic provisioning now obtains a Mac widget-extension profile, but Xcode rejects the containing app because the configured Personal Team does not support Push Notifications. An enrolled team is needed for the current app capabilities. No production entitlement was removed and no app installed. See `release-environment-check.json`. The named Todoist retry gate and Mac attachment handoff remain accepted; old launch approvals are not current blockers.

12 October: native Mac shared-access loss now preserves offline edits, unblocks unrelated personal sync and restores owned copies through the native encrypted preview. Fixed the disappearing recovery notice in both apps and its sidebar/large-text layout. Broader recovery variants remain open; see `access-recovery-evidence.json`.

12 October: temporary native Mac VoiceOver enable/restore is verified, but the output surface timed out in computer use. Spoken output/traversal acceptance remains open; native accessibility labels alone are insufficient. Original off setting is restored. See `critical-accessibility-evidence.json`.

12 October: corrected misleading sync captions and success icons in both apps. Initial/failed/pending states are distinct from confirmed success; see `sync-status-evidence.json`.

12 October: resolved the retained midnight publishing warning in both apps by scheduling system calendar notifications before SwiftUI receives them. The new iPhone background-event case reproduces it before the fix; afterward it and the affected largest capture pass without structured warnings. Native Mac day/zone refresh also passes. Debug/Release builds pass; broader release gates remain open. See `background-calendar-evidence.json`.

12 October: real Mac Focus delivery after normal Quit reaches Notification Center history while the app stays stopped; fixture-preserving relaunch retains the finished session and open task. Existing DND suppresses banner/sound. Actual Open/actions remain unaccepted; see `mac-focus-terminated-evidence.json`.
