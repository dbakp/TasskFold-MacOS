# Email-to-task intake

Updated 23 October 2026. The user has no inbound provider/domain yet and explicitly
authorized preparation for later configuration. Build the intake feature now; do
not enable live delivery or imply that a working address exists before provider
configuration and real signed-delivery acceptance.

## Delivery order and current evidence

| Stage | Required result | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content and retry contract | Bounded plain text; transparent attachment omissions; a stable provider-delivery/route identity separate from content fingerprint | Implemented independently in each repo; ten Deno tests and lint pass per repo |
| Atomic intake journal and routes | One committed task per verified delivery; changed-content replays conflict; paused/revoked or unauthorized destinations refuse delivery; quotas and account-removal fencing | Implemented as a disabled local candidate; 119 functional and 32 real PostgreSQL concurrency checks per repo pass; hosted/provider/native acceptance remains open |
| Provider adapter and management gateway | Verify signed provider requests before trusting normalized sender/receipt data; authorize current native sessions; bounded body/read/deadlines and admission; no raw credentials in receipts | Open; provider/domain configuration will follow later |
| Native setup and recovery | Clear address/destination review, trusted senders, pause/rotate/revoke, account-bound private setup/retry, understandable delivery status and accessible controls | Open; retain current app typography, spacing and privacy controls |
| Real delivery acceptance | Actual provider retries, sender spoof refusal, current membership changes, native relaunch/account isolation and recovery | Open; requires later provider/domain configuration |

## Implemented internal contract

`supabase/functions/_shared/email-content.ts` is an internal component, not an
HTTP endpoint, authentication mechanism or task writer. Version 1 accepts exactly
`subject`, `text`, `attachmentCount` and `version`. The subject is at most 512
UTF-8 bytes; plain text is at most 60,000 bytes. Oversize input fails instead of
being silently truncated. Binary controls, header line breaks, ill-formed Unicode,
unknown fields/versions and mail without readable subject/body fail explicitly.
A verified adapter must decode MIME and unfold subject headers before calling it.
HTML-only mail must not become a silent empty task; adapter handling remains open.

The subject becomes a trimmed title, falling back to “Email task” only when a
readable body exists. The complete plain-text body preserves whitespace and
Unicode, normalizing CRLF/CR to LF. Attachments are not fetched/imported; a note
explicitly reports their number. Subject/body instructions remain text and never
set scheduling, priority, assignment or destination. The returned content does
not contain sender addresses, recipient aliases, provider tokens or file URLs.
Rendering through the app’s existing safe note renderer remains a native gate.

`prepareEmailDelivery` additionally accepts a canonical internal route UUID, a
configured provider namespace and the verified provider’s stable delivery receipt
ID. Header `Message-ID` is sender-controlled and must not substitute for that
receipt. The SHA-256 delivery key has a versioned namespace and does not include
content. A separate content fingerprint covers normalized title/note and omitted
attachment count. Identical receipt/route retries retain the delivery key; changed
content retains that key but changes the fingerprint. The candidate journal enforces
this distinction atomically without overwriting a task or creating another one.
Different provider namespaces or routes cannot share a delivery key.

## Boundaries the next stages must enforce

- Authenticate the provider event before accepting sender or receipt metadata. A
  payload’s `senderVerified` flag, display name or unverified From header is not
  proof; unknown fields are already refused by the content contract. Choose the
  actual provider adapter after configuration is available.
- Bind routes to the authenticated owner and approved sender addresses. Recheck
  current destination access and archived state at delivery, including shared
  project membership. Unavailable destinations must not silently become Inbox.
- Store alias secrets separately from task content, widgets, exports and logs.
  Native management must use live account/session guards and durable, scoped
  recovery. Address rotation/revocation must invalidate the old route capability.
- Commit journal identity and task creation in one transaction, preserving the
  original task ID/generation after retries, user edits or deletion. Do not recreate
  a user-deleted task on late delivery. Bound retention, payload size, attempts and
  per-provider/account/sender/recipient admission. State limits and retention before
  implementing cleanup; deleting receipts must not silently re-enable old replay.
- Integrate account-removal locks and erase route/private receipt state without
  deleting another account’s tasks or shared work. Reject late deliveries after
  account removal or membership loss. Expired native sessions must block route
  management; provider capture may continue while the native app is signed out.
- Show configuration/unsupported-mail failures clearly. Only a real configured
  address may be copied as usable; preparation must never claim delivery works.

The first content milestone is recorded in `p2-email-content-evidence.json`.
Existing remote-reminder, older-client rollout, distribution, calendar-provider
and physical-location deferrals remain unchanged.

## Atomic routes and delivery journal — local candidate

The independently owned migration `20261023150729_email_intake_journal.sql` now
implements private routes, setup-cancellation tombstones and atomic task/receipt
creation. Delivery is disabled by default. No hosted migration or endpoint has
been deployed. Service-only functions are an internal trusted boundary; they do
not themselves verify a provider signature or make sender claims trustworthy.

Route management requires a current native Auth session and confirmed account
email. The initial approved sender is only that current confirmed email; additional
verified sender enrollment remains open. Addresses use hashed aliases, strict
account ownership and revision-checked pause/resume, rotation and terminal
revocation. Cancel-before-create is durable. Destination access, membership and
archive state are rechecked; a deleted destination cannot fall back to Inbox.
Expired native sessions block management. Provider capture can continue while the
app is signed out/offline, until route, account, sender or destination access is
invalidated. Account-removal, Auth, session and project changes are fenced with
transaction locks.

A verified future adapter must supply the original provider receipt and received
timestamp, not sender-controlled Message-ID/Date/From or a `senderVerified` flag.
PostgreSQL recomputes the versioned delivery key and content fingerprint. Task and
receipt commit together. Exact retries return an opaque acknowledgement, without
IDs or task content. Changed content/timestamps conflict. User edits, moves,
deletion and restored task incarnations are preserved. Resume refuses new mail
from its paused interval; known committed retries can still be acknowledged.

Initial limits are five live routes including paused routes, ten new routes per
rolling day, 100 setup-cancellation tombstones per day, 100 accepted captures per
account/day, 50 per route/hour and 6,000 retained receipts per account. Gateway
budgets for rejected requests, provider and IP admission remain open. Revisit
these limits against provider costs before enabling delivery.

Receipts become eligible for pruning after both creation and original receipt
are older than 30 days; revoked routes require no remaining receipts. Old setup
cancellations are also prunable. Activity and an administrative RPC perform
bounded per-account cleanup. Scheduled maintenance for inactive accounts remains
required; this is not a promise of exact automatic 30-day deletion. Seven-day
input/setup windows prevent unchanged ancient requests recreating work after
pruning. The journal stores identity hashes, timestamps and task generation, not
another email body, raw alias or provider payload.

Each repo passes 119 functional checks and 32 actual PostgreSQL 17.6 concurrency
checks, including ten observed blocking barriers, twelve simultaneous identical
deliveries, injected transaction failure and quota contention. Existing webhook
concurrency checks pass 43 cases per repo after the fixture extension. Official
Supabase advisors ran against each local fixture: no email-object findings; five
pre-existing minimal-fixture findings remain. This is not a production database
audit. All owned containers were removed. Exact checks, source hashes, candidate
corrections and limits are in `p2-email-intake-journal-evidence.json`.

Still required: authenticated management/admission gateway, signed provider/MIME
adapter with attested sender and original receipt time, native alias generation
and private vault/recovery/UI, additional sender verification, source links,
scheduled maintenance and hosted/native/provider acceptance. Provider/domain
configuration stays deferred by the user. Full email intake and Px remain open.
